                        Created a platform based game, in which the objective is to escape out of a prison. The player is given 6 lives, which can each be taken away from by the player hitting either a spike or a guard. The main objective of the game is to escape, however there are coins along the way that will increase your score. To move, use the up, down, right, and left arrows and to shoot your gun, use z and x.
